# Main IDSS Article #

Placeholder for the main article we write for a high-profile archaeological journal on the algorithm.  

This article should:

1. Review the main outlines of seriation, its theoretical underpinnings, and its CH usage
2. Review the main approaches and describe the issues with similarity-based seriation
3. Link the "seriation assumptions" described by Rouse, Ford, and RCD to their causation in the tolerance limits of observing continuous cultural transmission using discrete classes and closed arrays 
4. Describe how this leads directly to a "multiple spatial solutions" paradigm rather than the arbitrary exercise of shoving all sampled assemblages into a single solution
5. Move to describing a new deterministic algorithm for doing seriation with multiple spatial solutions and various measures of solution quality and statistical fit.
