## Summary ##

Iterative Spatial Deterministic frequency seriation is a method of ordering empirical units (e.g., assemblages, sites,
objects) using a set of descriptive units (e.g., classes, types), a determinisitic model for the expected
distribution of those classes across empirical units, and statistical techniques for incorporating the effects of
finite samping of the empirical units.

Traditional frequency seriation (and most types of probabilistic seriation) begins with a set of empirical units
(hereafter, "assemblages") for simplicity, and attempts to find a single ordering into which the classes can order
the assemblages, with a minimum of violations of the ordering principle used.

The expected ordering principle is invariably that, when ordered properly, the frequency distributions of each class
used to order assemblages displays a unimodal distribution.  In casual discourse, this principle is said to be
underlain by the "popularity principle," by which a complex set of attributes comes into being, is learned and
transmitted to others in a group, attains a maximum degree of prevalence or popularity at some point in time, and
thereafter declines, eventually going "extinct."

It is important to recognize that frequency seriation is not a claim that __all classes or types display this
behavior__, nor a claim that __cultural variation in general__ is distributed in this manner.  It is, instead, an
observation that because of the continuity of cultural transmission within populations, __if we select and
construct classes that have this kind of distribution, and use them to order assemblages__, the resulting order will
reflect the spatiotemporal relatedness (or "historical continuity") of the variants in those assemblages.
